"""

Can we have a set with 18 (int) and '18' (str) as a value in it 

i think we cant ,
as set usually contains similar elements , usually integers 
but we can convert it by str ()

but you are wrong , str can contain both 

as 18 integer and '18' strings both both will have different values 
so it can be stored like 
18 and '18'
