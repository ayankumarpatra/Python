'''
tupple is just like lists ..

but here only brackets are ()

tuple also can contain similar or different data types 

like

'''

friends=(1,2,3,4,5)

print (type(friends))

# or different types like 

friends2=("Hello world",1,2,3,5.67,False,"Thank you harry bhai")

print (type(friends2))

'''
empty tupple 

if you create tupple like 
'''

a=(1)
print (type(a))
# it will bw treated as integer only , now to create a tupple with a single element , then 
b=(1,)
# it will be now treated as tupple 
print (type(b))
# empty tupple like c=()
c=()
print (type(c))

'''
just like strings , tupples are also immutable , means you cant change the tupple elements
