like in strrings we usually do , only to print , we cant re assign 

str = "Hello world"
print (str[0]) #it will print h only ,
"""
str = "Hello world"
print (str[0])

# now lets learn lists , just kike arrays and structure combo , lets see 

list1=("hello","world",3.34,5,False)

# list1[0] will refer to hello , or list1[3] will be 3.34

print (list1[0],list1[2])# it will print hello 3.34

#unlike strings , lists are modifiable or mutable
