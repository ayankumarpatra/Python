# 1. Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, / etc. 

a=34
b=48

c=a+b
print (c)


# 2. Assignment operators:  =, +=, -= etc. 

a=4 # a have assigned the value of 4
b+=3# b=b+3 , similsarly -=3 or *=3, multiply by 3

# 3. Comparison operators: ==, >, >=, <,  != etc. 

d=5<4 # if the statement is true then it will contain true else false 
# but here 5<4 it is false so it will contain false 
# also like if given 5>4 it will contain true then and note comarison operator will return a boolean value only 
# eg true of false .. also it contains > or < or <= or >= or != or ==
print(d)# it will print False


# 4. Logical operators: and, or, not.
