# you can similarly print tthe multi line comments , actually the multi line comments are multi line 
# strings , so the strings inside comment will be printed as it is like 

print("""      Hello world 
      I am ayan kumar patra and 
      yes i can do it ,
      if not i , then who ..""")# instead of " single double quote ,you have to use """ triple double quote or ''' triple 
# single quote , otherwise it will throw an error
